# Autofill fields in SEPA in standard contributions for CiviCRM

This module extends the [SEPA in standard contributions module](https://github.com/gellweiler/net.gellweiler.sepacontribution). It provides the ability to store banking information in the contacts dashboard. These informations will then be used to prefill the fields in the contribution form. The external identifier is used as mandate id.
